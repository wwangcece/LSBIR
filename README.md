> Image rescaling aims to learn the optimal downscaled low-resolution (LR) image that can be accurately reconstructed to its original high-resolution (HR) counterpart. This process is crucial for efficient image processing and storage, especially in the era of ultra-high definition media. However, extreme downscaling factors pose significant challenges due to the highly ill-posed nature of the inverse upscaling process, causing existing methods to struggle in generating semantically plausible structures and perceptually rich textures. In this work, we propose a novel framework called Latent Space Based Image Rescaling (LSBIR) for extreme image rescaling tasks. LSBIR effectively leverages powerful natural image priors learned by a pre-trained text-to-image diffusion model to generate realistic HR images. The rescaling is performed in the latent space of a pre-trained image encoder and decoder, which offers better perceptual reconstruction quality due to its stronger sparsity and richer semantics. LSBIR adopts a two-stage training strategy. In the first stage, a pseudo-invertible encoder-decoder models the bidirectional mapping between the latent features of the HR image and the target-sized LR image. In the second stage, the reconstructed features from the first stage are refined by a pre-trained diffusion model to generate more faithful and visually pleasing details. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of LSBIR over previous methods in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations.
